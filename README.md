# Circular-linked-list-of-Stacks
Project to show a simple implementation of a doubly linked circular list of stacks in C++

To keep the project simple to visually test, the project has the following limitations for the user:
1) The linked list is limited to 5 nodes (each node containing a stack)
2) Each stack is limited to 5 elements
3) Each element inside a stack is an integer from 0 to 9

This way, the user can easily test stack operations such as checking if the stack is full, empty, or trying to push an element to a full stack.
Similarly, the limitation of nodes to 5, makes it easier to test how the list behaves when nodes get inserted or deleted, especially when the list is full or empty.
